## Laravel 11 + Inertia SSR with JetStream + Bootstrap 5 + vite

Following things are installed and working

- Laravel 11
- Inertia with SSR
- Bootstrap 5
- Vite

This repo is based on https://github.com/nascent-africa/jetstrap which replaces 
all the tailwind css with boostrap.
Feel free to fork it and use it as you like. 


Steps to get it up and running. 

1. `composer install` (it will install all the php dependencies)
2. `npm install or yarn install `(it will install all the javascript dependencies).

Create fresh database first and then run

3. `php artisan migrate` (it will migrate all the tables that came with jetstream).
